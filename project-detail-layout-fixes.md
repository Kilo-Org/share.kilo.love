# Project Detail Page Layout Fixes

This document outlines the layout issues that need to be fixed on the project detail page (`src/pages/projects/[id].astro`) based on visual analysis of the current implementation.

## Issues to Fix

### 1. Duplicate Title Display
**Problem**: The page title appears twice - once from the Layout component header and again in the hero section.
**Fix**: Pass `showTitle={false}` to the Layout component to prevent the automatic title display, keeping only the hero section title.

### 2. Excessive White Space in Hero Section
**Problem**: The hero section has too much vertical padding (`py-32 sm:py-40`) creating large empty areas.
**Fix**: Reduce padding to `py-16 sm:py-24` for better proportions and less wasted space.

### 3. Content Width and Overflow Issues
**Problem**: Text content runs too wide without proper constraints, making it hard to read and causing horizontal overflow.
**Fix**: 
- Add proper max-width constraints to the prose content
- Implement consistent container widths throughout the page
- Ensure all content respects layout boundaries

### 4. Poor Prose Styling and Readability
**Problem**: The prose content lacks proper line length limits and spacing for optimal readability.
**Fix**: 
- Improve the prose classes with better max-width (around 65-75 characters per line)
- Enhance line-height and paragraph spacing
- Add proper typography scale for better hierarchy

### 5. Video/Media Element Sizing Problems
**Problem**: Video players and media elements appear cut off or improperly sized.
**Fix**: 
- Implement proper aspect ratio containers for videos
- Add responsive video player styling with `aspect-video` classes
- Ensure media elements scale properly across all screen sizes

### 6. Code Block Formatting and Overflow
**Problem**: Code blocks overflow horizontally and don't format properly, appearing inline when they should be block-level.
**Fix**: 
- Enhance code block styling to prevent horizontal overflow
- Add proper scrolling for long code lines
- Improve syntax highlighting and formatting
- Ensure code blocks are properly contained within the layout

### 7. Inconsistent Visual Hierarchy and Spacing
**Problem**: Sections lack proper spacing and visual separation, creating a cramped appearance.
**Fix**: 
- Adjust spacing between major sections (metadata, author info, content)
- Improve heading styles and their spacing relationships
- Create better visual rhythm throughout the page

### 8. Hero Section Image Positioning Issues
**Problem**: The hero image positioning is inconsistent and doesn't align properly with the text content.
**Fix**: 
- Fix the complex grid layout that's causing alignment problems
- Simplify the grid structure for better responsiveness
- Ensure proper image aspect ratios and positioning

### 9. Content Container Overflow
**Problem**: Content breaks out of intended containers, especially on smaller screens.
**Fix**: 
- Add proper overflow handling for all content types
- Implement consistent padding and margins
- Ensure content never breaks the layout boundaries
- Add proper word-wrapping for long URLs and text

### 10. Mobile Responsiveness Problems
**Problem**: Layout breaks down on mobile devices with poor spacing and alignment.
**Fix**: 
- Fix layout breakpoints for better mobile experience
- Improve touch targets and spacing on mobile
- Ensure all content is accessible and readable on small screens
- Test and adjust grid layouts for mobile viewports

### 11. Metadata and Author Section Spacing
**Problem**: The metadata (dates, author info, stats) sections have inconsistent spacing and alignment.
**Fix**: 
- Standardize spacing between metadata elements
- Improve alignment of author information and avatar
- Fix engagement stats layout and spacing
- Ensure consistent typography in these sections

### 12. "About This Project" Section Layout
**Problem**: The main content section has poor typography and layout, making it hard to read.
**Fix**: 
- Improve the section heading spacing and typography
- Enhance the prose container for better content flow
- Fix any formatting issues with embedded content
- Ensure proper spacing around the section

## Implementation Notes

- All changes should be made to `src/pages/projects/[id].astro`
- Test changes across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Verify that the fixes work with different types of content (long text, code blocks, images, videos)
- Ensure accessibility standards are maintained
- Use existing Tailwind CSS classes where possible for consistency
- Test with actual GitHub discussion content to ensure real-world compatibility

## Expected Outcome

After implementing these fixes, the project detail page should have:
- Clean, professional layout without duplicate elements
- Proper content hierarchy and readability
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Well-formatted code blocks and media elements
- Consistent spacing and visual rhythm
- No content overflow or layout breaking issues
